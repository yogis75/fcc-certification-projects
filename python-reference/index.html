        <p>This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is not intended as a tutorial.</p>
        <p>While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time â€” or invent a cloning machine :-).</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Lexical_analysis">
        <header>Lexical analysis</header>
        <p>A Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyzer. This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.</p>
        <P>Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source file can be given by an encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. If the source file cannot be decoded, a SyntaxError is raised.</p>

        <header>The import system</header>
        <p>Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way. Functions such as importlib.import_module() and built-in __import__() can also be used to invoke the import machinery.</p>
        <P>The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is defined as a call to the __import__() function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of __import__() is used to perform the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.</p>
        <P>A direct call to __import__() performs only the module search and, if found, the module creation operation. While certain side-effects may occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the updating of various caches (including sys.modules), only the import statement performs a name binding operation.</P>
        <P>When an import statement is executed, the standard builtin __import__() function is called. Other mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as importlib.import_module()) may choose to bypass __import__() and use their own solutions to implement import semantics.</p>
        <P>When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it creates a module object 1, initializing it. If the named module cannot be found, a ModuleNotFoundError is raised. Python implements various strategies to search for the named module when the import machinery is invoked. These strategies can be modified and extended by using various hooks described in the sections below.

      <section class="main-section" id="Expressions">
        <header>Expressions</header>
        <p>This chapter explains the meaning of the elements of expressions in Python.</p>  
        <p><strong>Syntax Notes:</strong> In this and the following chapters, extended BNF notation will be used to describe syntax, not lexical analysis. When (one alternative of) a syntax rule has the form</p>
        <code>name ::=  othername</code>
        <p>and no semantics are given, the semantics of this form of name are the same as for othername.</p>

        <header>Simple Statements</header>
        <code><pre>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Compound_statements">
        <header>Compound statements</header>
        <p>Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.</p>
        <p>The if, while and for statements implement traditional control flow constructs. try specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements.</p>
        <p>A compound statement consists of one or more 'clauses.' A clause consists of a header and a 'suite.' The clause headers of a particular compound statement are all at the same indentation level. Each clause header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a colon. A suite is a group of statements controlled by a clause. A suite can be one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the same line as the header, following the header's colon, or it can be one or more indented statements on subsequent lines. Only the latter form of a suite can contain nested compound statements; the following is illegal, mostly because it wouldn't be clear to which if clause a following else clause would belong:</p>

<code>if test1: if test2: print(x)</code>
<p>Also note that the semicolon binds tighter than the colon in this context, so that in the following example, either all or none of the print() calls are executed:</p>
<code>if x < y < z: print(x); print(y); print(z)</code>
<p>Summarizing:</p>
<code><pre>compound_stmt ::=  if_stmt
                   | while_stmt
                   | for_stmt
                   | try_stmt
                   | with_stmt
                   | match_stmt
                   | funcdef
                   | classdef
                   | async_with_stmt
                   | async_for_stmt
                   | async_funcdef
suite         ::=  stmt_list NEWLINE | NEWLINE INDENT statement+ DEDENT
statement     ::=  stmt_list NEWLINE | compound_stmt
stmt_list     ::=  simple_stmt (";" simple_stmt)* [";"]
</pre></code>
<p>Note that statements always end in a NEWLINE possibly followed by a DEDENT. Also note that optional continuation clauses always begin with a keyword that cannot start a statement, thus there are no ambiguities (the 'dangling else' problem is solved in Python by requiring nested if statements to be indented).</p>
<p>The formatting of the grammar rules in the following sections places each clause on a separate line for clarity.</p>

        <p>The Python interpreter can get its input from a number of sources: from a script passed to it as standard input or as program argument, typed in interactively, from a module source file, etc. This chapter gives the syntax used in these cases.</p>
